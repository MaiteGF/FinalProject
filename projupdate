## Introduction
Description of data and problem(s) you are solving.  Include data source(s) here, either through citation or link to webpage.

## Graphic 1
I wanted to see how Bottlenose dolphins are obtained an how that has changed over the time frame that we have data for. 
This graphic shows the acquisition type on the y axis and the orginDate on the x axis. Each individual Bottlenose is represented by a point.
We can see that captureing was the primary method from the 1950s to about 1990, where it came to an abrupt stop. Many are rescued and born into captivity starting in the 1970s, but being born is definitely the primary way that Bottlenose dolphins end up in captivity from the 1970s on. 
```{r}
Plot <- select(mydata, species, acquisition, originDate) %>%
  filter(species == "Bottlenose") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = originDate, y = acquisition))
print(Plot + ggtitle("Acquisition of Bottlenose Dolphins over Time"))
```

## Graphic 2 - if two people in group
I wanted to see how the use of caturing cetaceans has changed over time, for the data available. 
This graphic shows all the species of captured cetaceans from the 1940s to 2000. The graphic shows the species on the y axis and the orginDate on the x axis. Each dot represents a single individual of each species that was captured. Bottlenose dolphins were the first species captured in the the late 40s, and the most abundant throughout the years. During the early 60's the number of species being captured increased. From the 60s to the mid 80s the number of individial ceteaceans and amount of species increased but dramatically decreased during the 90s. This abrupt stop in the use of cature was a result of captive breeding.

```{r}
Plot <- select(mydata, species, acquisition, originDate) %>%
  filter(acquisition=="Capture") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = originDate, y = species))
print(Plot + ggtitle("Use of Capture of Cetaceans over Time"))
#include code for any data manipulation and variable creation used to create teh graphic as well as the code for the graph creation - be sure to comment all code with description of steps being completed with each line of code
